**Summary of Script Workflow**

Imports & Setup

Brings in Python’s os module for file‐system operations and xlwings to control Excel.

Assumes a default working folder (C:\Weekly Report Bot), which can be overridden if needed.

Opening the Master Workbook

Scans the target folder for the first Excel file whose name contains both “Autohedge” and “master.”

Opens that file in Excel and returns a handle for further manipulation.

If no matching file is found, it logs a message and proceeds without error.

Processing Weekly‑Meeting Files

Looks through the same folder for any Excel or CSV files named with “(Weekly meeting 7 day).”

Opens each found file, goes to its first worksheet, and identifies the last filled row in column M.

Inserts a SUM formula below that last row to total the values in M2 through M[last row], and labels column L of that row as “Total.”

Saves each workbook after updating it, and keeps track of all opened books.

Script Entry Point

Ensures that the master‐file and weekly‐meeting routines run only when the script is executed directly (not when imported).

Calls the two main functions in sequence, printing status messages as it goes.

Includes optional (commented‑out) code to close workbooks or quit Excel when finished.

Key Practices & Design

Modularity: Separate, well‑named functions for each major task.

Robustness: Checks file existence and naming before attempting to open.

Automation: Hands‑off processing—no manual Excel edits needed.

Flexibility: Easy to point at a different directory or adjust worksheet targets.

Extensibility: Returns workbook objects so you can plug in extra data‐processing steps if required.
